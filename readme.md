# Uniform keyboard teaching assistant

A browser-based application to aid in learning how a uniform keyboard is structured/played, displaying how scales and chords fall onto the keys with intuitive color-coded labels.

Thanks to visualizations for harmonic progressions, expectations, and tension, the application can also aid in teaching some basics of harmony (music theory lessons not included!).

The application offers a platform for "pre-recorded" tutorials as well as online lessons, thanks to live listening rooms and chatting.

A live version of the application is hosted on [Firebase hosting](https://uniform-keyboard.firebaseapp.com/).
